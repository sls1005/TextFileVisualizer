  I am the original author of this icon and of this vector file.
  The icon consists of a capitalized M combined with the symbol for space.
  I invented it to represent the meaning of "monospaced text" and use it to represent an action or state. It is not used for identity, but for meaning.
  The symbol is not copyrighted, as it consists of only common and simple symbols.
  This file is copyrighted, as the vector path is manually written.
